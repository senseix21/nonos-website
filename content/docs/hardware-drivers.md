# NØNOS Hardware Drivers

**Version 0.8.0** | March 2026

NØNOS includes drivers for essential hardware classes—storage, networking, input, graphics, audio, and security devices. This document details supported hardware, driver capabilities, and compatibility information.


## Driver Architecture

NØNOS uses a modular driver architecture where device drivers register with the kernel to handle specific hardware. Device discovery occurs during boot through:

1. **ACPI Table Parsing** — Platform devices
2. **PCI Bus Scanning** — PCI/PCIe devices
3. **USB Enumeration** — USB devices (after xHCI initializes)

Each discovered device is matched against registered drivers using vendor ID, device ID, and device class. When a match is found, the driver's probe function initializes the hardware.


## Storage Drivers

Storage drivers enable access to hard drives, SSDs, and removable media. All storage drivers operate through the kernel's block layer, providing a uniform interface regardless of the underlying technology.

### AHCI (SATA)

**Status:** Production-ready

The AHCI driver supports SATA devices connected to Advanced Host Controller Interface compliant controllers. Most modern motherboards use AHCI for SATA connectivity.

**Features:**

| Feature | Support |
|---------|---------|
| Read/Write Operations | Full |
| Native Command Queuing (NCQ) | Yes |
| Multiple Port Support | Up to 32 ports |
| Hot Plug | Partial |
| DMA Transfers | Yes |
| Error Recovery | Full |

**Supported Controllers:**

Any AHCI-compliant controller is supported. The driver identifies controllers by PCI class code `0x0106` (AHCI SATA controller).

**Boot Output Example:**

```
ahci ok ports=1 r=0 w=0
```

This shows one AHCI port detected with zero read/write operations (fresh boot).

### NVMe

**Status:** Production-ready

The NVMe driver supports NVM Express solid-state drives, which provide significantly higher performance than SATA through deeper command queues and reduced latency.

**Features:**

| Feature | Support |
|---------|---------|
| Read/Write Operations | Full |
| Queue Pairs | Multiple (configurable) |
| MSI-X Interrupts | Yes |
| Multiple Namespaces | Yes |
| Admin Commands | Full |
| Firmware Download | Read-only |

**Performance:**

NVMe drives can achieve much higher throughput than SATA drives. NØNOS's NVMe driver utilizes submission and completion queue pairs for efficient command processing.

**Boot Output Example:**

```
nvme ok ns=1 br=0 bw=0
```

One namespace detected, zero bytes read/written.

### VirtIO Block

**Status:** Production-ready

The VirtIO block driver supports paravirtualized storage in virtual machine environments (QEMU, KVM, etc.). VirtIO provides efficient virtualized I/O through shared memory rings, avoiding the overhead of emulating physical hardware.

**Features:**

| Feature | Support |
|---------|---------|
| Read/Write Operations | Full |
| Scatter-Gather I/O | Yes |
| Virtqueue Protocol | Yes |
| Interrupt Handling | MSI-X |

**When to Use:**

If you're running NØNOS in QEMU or another hypervisor, VirtIO offers better performance than emulating AHCI or NVMe hardware.

### USB Mass Storage

**Status:** Basic

USB mass storage support allows access to USB flash drives and external hard drives through the USB Mass Storage Class protocol layered over SCSI commands.

**Features:**

| Feature | Support |
|---------|---------|
| Read Operations | Yes |
| Write Operations | Yes |
| Hot Plug | Basic |
| Multiple LUNs | No |

**Supported Device Types:**

## Graphics Drivers

### UEFI GOP (Graphics Output Protocol)

**Status:** Production-ready

The UEFI GOP driver uses the framebuffer established by UEFI during boot. This provides basic graphics capability on any UEFI system without hardware-specific drivers.

**Features:**

| Feature | Support |
|---------|---------|
| Linear Framebuffer | Yes |
| Multiple Resolutions | Yes (UEFI-dependent) |
| 32-bit Color | Yes |

- Higher resolutions (UEFI-dependent)

**Boot Output Example:**

```
gpu ok 0000:0000 frames=0
```

**Notes:**

The GOP driver provides software rendering only. There's no GPU acceleration for 3D graphics or video decode. For general computing and the NØNOS desktop, this is sufficient.

### VGA Text Mode

Eight PCI devices found, two with MSI-X capability.


## Serial Console

**Status:** Production-ready

The serial console driver outputs to COM1 (port 0x3F8) at 115200 baud. This provides diagnostic output that can be captured by external systems even during early boot or kernel panics.

**Features:**

| Feature | Support |
|---------|---------|
| COM1 (0x3F8) | Yes |
| COM2 (0x2F8) | No |
| Baud Rate | 115200 fixed |

```bash
# Linux/macOS
screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200

# QEMU adds serial output to terminal
qemu-system-x86_64 ... -serial mon:stdio
```


## Adding Hardware Support

If your hardware isn't supported, NØNOS's modular driver architecture allows adding new drivers. The process involves:

1. Create a driver module matching the device class
2. Implement probe and remove functions
3. Register with the appropriate subsystem (PCI, USB, etc.)
4. Handle device-specific initialization

Drivers must be signed and can be loaded at boot time. See the [Module System](/docs/architecture/kernel-abi/#module-system) documentation.


## Checking Hardware Compatibility

Before installing NØNOS on physical hardware, verify driver support:

```bash
# In NØNOS
lspci              # List PCI devices
lsusb              # List USB devices
dmesg | grep drv   # Check driver loading

# From Linux (before installing)
lspci -nn          # Shows vendor:device IDs
lsusb -v           # Detailed USB info
```

Compare the vendor:device IDs against the supported lists above.


## Driver Statistics

Each driver maintains statistics for diagnostics:

```bash
# View driver stats in dmesg output
dmesg | grep -E "(ahci|nvme|e1000)"
```

Statistics include:
- Read/write operation counts
- Byte throughput
- Error counts
- Interrupt counts


## Known Limitations

| Hardware Type | Limitation |
|---------------|------------|
| NVMe | Firmware update read-only |
| WiFi | Some access points incompatible |
| USB | No isochronous transfers (webcams, audio) |
| Audio | Basic functionality only |
| GPU | No hardware acceleration |
| Bluetooth | Not supported |
| Fingerprint | Not supported |
| IR Receivers | Not supported |


## Hardware Recommendations

For best compatibility:

| Component | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Storage | NVMe or SATA SSD |
| Network | Intel Gigabit Ethernet |
| WiFi | Intel AX200 (if WiFi needed) |
| Input | PS/2 or basic USB keyboard/mouse |
| Graphics | Any UEFI GOP-capable system |
| Security | TPM 2.0 (recommended, not required) |

For testing, QEMU with VirtIO devices provides excellent compatibility:

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -drive if=virtio,format=raw,file=disk.img \
  -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=net0 \
  -netdev user,id=net0
```
