# NØNOS Cryptography

**Version 0.8.0** | March 2026

NØNOS implements cryptography from first principles—no OpenSSL, no system libraries, no external dependencies that could be compromised. Every primitive is built from specification, verified against test vectors, and analyzed for timing leaks.

This document covers every cryptographic algorithm in NØNOS: what it does, when it's used, and the security guarantees it provides.


## Design Principles

### Zero Dependencies

Every cryptographic primitive is implemented in the kernel itself or compiled from audited source code. There are no runtime dependencies on external libraries. This eliminates:

- Supply chain attacks through compromised libraries
- Version mismatch vulnerabilities
- Dynamic linking attacks

### Constant-Time Execution

All cryptographic operations that handle secret data use constant-time implementations. This means:

- No secret-dependent branches
- No secret-dependent memory access patterns
- No early-exit on comparison operations
- Timing attacks cannot leak key material

### Multiple Security Levels

NØNOS supports both classical cryptography (secure against conventional computers) and post-quantum cryptography (secure against quantum computers). For sensitive long-term secrets, post-quantum algorithms are recommended.


## Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption uses the same key for encryption and decryption. Fast and efficient for bulk data.

### AES-256-GCM

**What It Is:**
Advanced Encryption Standard with Galois/Counter Mode. A block cipher operating on 128-bit blocks with a 256-bit key, combined with authentication.

**Properties:**

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Key Size | 256 bits |
| Block Size | 128 bits |
| Mode | GCM (authenticated) |
| Tag Size | 128 bits |
| Nonce | 96 bits |

**When It's Used:**
- Vault key encryption
- Module encryption at rest
- Wallet private key storage

**Security:**
- Provides confidentiality and authenticity
- Tampering detected before decryption
- 128-bit security against forgery
- 256-bit security against key recovery

**Implementation Notes:**
NØNOS includes both a pure-software implementation (for UEFI bootloader where AES-NI may not be initialized) and a hardware-accelerated implementation using AES-NI instructions when available.

### ChaCha20-Poly1305

**What It Is:**
A stream cipher (ChaCha20) combined with a message authentication code (Poly1305). An alternative to AES-GCM that doesn't require hardware acceleration for good performance.

**Properties:**

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Key Size | 256 bits |
| Nonce | 96 bits (standard) or 192 bits (XChaCha20) |
| Tag Size | 128 bits |

**When It's Used:**
- CryptoFS block encryption
- Network traffic encryption
- TLS 1.3 cipher suite
- Full-disk encryption (planned)

**Security:**

**XChaCha20 Variant:**
XChaCha20-Poly1305 uses a 192-bit nonce, allowing random nonce generation without collision risk. Used when generating unique nonces is impractical.

### AES-128-ECB

**What It Is:**
AES with Electronic Codebook mode. Each block encrypted independently.

**Warning:** ECB mode does not hide patterns in plaintext. Only used internally where pattern hiding is not required (e.g., key schedule computation).

## Zero-Knowledge Proofs

Zero-knowledge proofs let you prove you know something without revealing what you know.

### Groth16 (SNARKs)

- Hiding: Commitment reveals nothing about value

**When It's Used:**
- Building blocks for other ZK proofs

### Schnorr Proofs

**What It Is:**
Prove a value lies within a range without revealing the value.

**When It's Used:**
- Proving transaction amounts are positive

## Random Number Generation

### Hardware RNG

NØNOS uses hardware random number generators when available:

| Source | Method |
|--------|--------|
| RDRAND | Intel/AMD CPU instruction |
| RDSEED | Intel/AMD entropy seed |
| TPM 2.0 | Hardware security module |

**Entropy Quality:**
RDRAND output is assessed for quality. If entropy is insufficient, generation fails (rather than returning weak output).

### Software CSPRNG

When hardware RNG is unavailable or for additional entropy mixing:

**ChaCha20-based CSPRNG:**
- Seeded from hardware entropy
- Regular reseeding
- Fork-safe

### Entropy Collection

Boot entropy is collected from multiple sources:
- Hardware RNG (64 iterations)
- Time-stamp counter jitter
- RTC timestamp

Combined using BLAKE3 key derivation to produce high-quality output.


## Domain Separation

NØNOS uses domain separation strings to ensure keys/hashes derived for one purpose cannot be confused with another:

| Purpose | Domain Separator |
|---------|------------------|
| Key ID | `NONOS:KEYID:ED25519:v1` |
| Program Hash | `NONOS:ZK:PROGRAM:v1` |
| Capsule Commitment | `NONOS:CAPSULE:COMMITMENT:v1` |
| Audit Log | `NONOS:AUDIT:v1` |
| Entropy Accumulation | `NONOS:ENTROPY:ACCUM:v1` |
| Entropy Output | `NONOS:ENTROPY:OUTPUT:v1` |

This prevents attacks where output from one use is misused for another.
